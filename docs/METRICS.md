# Metrics Taxonomy

ABM metrics are atomic, numerical, time-bound, and attributable to both a Work Order and an Execution Cycle.

## Execution Metrics
- Execution latency
- Execution attempts
- Execution success
- Execution failure rate
- Idle time

## Coordination Metrics
- Work-in-progress (WIP) count
- Blocking time
- Serial dependency depth
- Parallelism factor
- Coordination overhead

## Verification Metrics
- Verification pass / fail
- Verification latency
- Verification retries
- Time-to-halt
- False progress

## Cost Metrics
- LLM call count
- Tool call count
- Token consumption (if available)
- Human touches
- Cost per completion
